# Weather Alert App

Weather Alert App is a real-time weather notification system utilizing Flask, Socket.IO, and external weather APIs. It allows users to retrieve and display weather alerts from various feeds and can query specific weather phenomena statistics using the IEM Cow API.

## Features

- Real-time updates of weather feeds using Flask and Socket.IO.
- User inputs for querying specific weather phenomena.
- Dark and light theme support.
- Responsive design suitable for desktop and mobile devices.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Node.js and npm (for compiling and managing JavaScript dependencies)

## Installation

To install Weather Alert App, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-alert-app.git
   cd weather-alert-app
   ```

2. **Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

To run Weather Alert App, use the following command from the root directory of the project, passing two IEMBOT ids as parameters:

```bash
python3 app.py aly box
```

This will start the Flask server on `http://localhost:5000`, where you can access the web interface.

You will be connected to IEMBOTS for Albany (aly) and Boston (box). A list of bots is available [here](https://weather.im/iembot/).

## Using the Application

- **Setting Refresh Interval:** Choose how often you want the feed to update from the dropdown menu.
- **Switching Themes:** Select your preferred theme (dark or light) from the theme dropdown.
- **Fetching Weather Stats:** Enter the WFO and phenomena code into the input fields and click "Get Cow Stats" to fetch statistics.
